## Lyrics for the optional sing-along

### Christmas Swingalong
Arr: Derek Ashmore

#### Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland
```
Sleigh bells ring, Are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistnin'
It's a beautiful sight, we're happy tonight,
Walkin' in a winter wonderland!
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song as we go along,
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown,
He'll say, "Are you married?"
  We'll say, "No, man!
But you can do the job when you're in town!"
Later on, we'll conspire,
  As we dream, by the fire,
To face unafraid, The plans that we made,
Walkin' in a winter wonderland!
```

#### All I want for Christmas is my Two Front Teeth
```
All I want for Christmas is my two
  front teeth,
  my two front teeth,
  see my two front teeth!
Gee, if I could only have my two
  front teeth,
  then I could wish you Merry Christmas.
It seems so long since I could say,
  “Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!”
Gosh oh gee, how happy I'd be,
  if I could only whistle (thhhh)
All I want for Christmas is my two
  front teeth,
  my two front teeth,
  see my two front teeth.
Gee, if I could only have my two
  front teeth,
  then I could wish you Merry Christmas!
```

#### Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas
```
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
Let your heart be light.
Next year all our troubles will be out
  of sight.
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
Make the Yuletide gay.
From now on our troubles will be miles away.
Here we are as in olden days, happy
  golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who are dear to us,
  will be near to us once more.
Someday soon we all will be together,
  if the Fates allow.
Until then we'll have to muddle
  through somehow.
So have yourself a merry little
  Christmas now.
```

### O Little Town of Bethlehem
English Traditional Melody
```
O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.

O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth
For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.

How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may hear His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel.
```

### O Come, All Ye Faithful
John Francis Wade
```
O come, all ye faithful,
Joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
Come and behold Him,
Born the King of Angels:
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.

God of God,
Light of Light,
Lo! He abhors not the Virgin's womb;
Very God,
Begotten not created:
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.

Sing, choirs of angels,
Sing in exultation,
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above,
Glory to God
In the highest:
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.
