### Christmas Swingalong

#### Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland
```
Sleigh bells ring, Are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistnin'
It's a beautiful sight, we're happy tonight,
Walkin' in a winter wonderland!
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song as we go along,
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown,
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No, man!
But you can do the job when you're in town!"
Later on, we'll conspire, As we dream, by the fire,
To face unafraid, The plans that we made,
Walkin' in a winter wonderland!
```

#### All I want for Christmas is my Two Front Teeth
```
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth,
my two front teeth, see my two front teeth!
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth,
then I could wish you Merry Christmas.
It seems so long since I could say,
“Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!”
Gosh oh gee, how happy I'd be,
if I could only whistle (thhhh)
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth,
my two front teeth, see my two front teeth.
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth,
then I could wish you Merry Christmas!
```

#### Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas
```
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
Let your heart be light.
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight.
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
Make the Yuletide gay.
From now on our troubles will be miles away.
Here we are as in olden days, happy golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who are dear to us, will be near to us once more.
Someday soon we all will be together, if the Fates allow.
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow.
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now.
```
